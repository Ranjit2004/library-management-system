Library Management System - CRUD Application

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
=================
This is a full-stack Library Management System that allows users to manage books, authors, and book issues/returns. The application provides a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for all entities with sorting capabilities.

TECHNOLOGIES UTILIZED:
======================
Frontend:
- HTML5 for structure and content
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design
- Vanilla JavaScript for client-side functionality

Backend:
- Node.js for server-side runtime environment
- Express.js for RESTful API framework
- MongoDB for database storage (with Mongoose ODM)

FEATURES:
=========
1. Authors Management:
   - Add, edit, delete authors
   - View all authors in a sortable table
   - Fields: ID, Name, Email, Bio

2. Books Management:
   - Add, edit, delete books
   - Assign books to authors
   - Track total and available copies
   - View all books in a sortable table
   - Fields: ID, Title, ISBN, Author, Publication Year, Genre, Available/Total Copies, Status

3. Issues/Returns Management:
   - Issue books to members
   - Mark books as returned
   - Track issue dates, due dates, and return dates
   - Automatic status tracking (Issued, Overdue, Returned)
   - View all issues in a sortable table
   - Fields: ID, Book, Member, Email, Issue Date, Due Date, Return Date, Status

SORTING FUNCTIONALITY:
=====================
- Inline sort icons integrated directly into table headers
- All sortable columns show visual indicators by default
- Click any column header to sort by that field
- First click sorts ascending (▲), second click sorts descending (▼)
- Visual feedback for current sort direction
- Consistent triangle icons for clear visual indication

ARCHITECTURE:
=============
- MVC-like structure with separation of concerns
- Models: Define data structures and database schemas
- Routes: Handle API endpoints for CRUD operations
- Public: Contains frontend assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Server: Entry point that initializes the application

DATABASE DESIGN:
================
- Authors Collection: Stores author information
- Books Collection: Stores book information with author references
- Issues Collection: Tracks book issues and returns
- Counters Collection: Manages auto-incrementing IDs

API ENDPOINTS:
==============
GET    /api/authors          - Retrieve all authors
POST   /api/authors          - Create a new author
GET    /api/authors/:id      - Retrieve a specific author
PUT    /api/authors/:id      - Update a specific author
DELETE /api/authors/:id      - Delete a specific author

GET    /api/books            - Retrieve all books
POST   /api/books            - Create a new book
GET    /api/books/:id        - Retrieve a specific book
PUT    /api/books/:id        - Update a specific book
DELETE /api/books/:id        - Delete a specific book

GET    /api/issues           - Retrieve all issues
POST   /api/issues           - Create a new issue
GET    /api/issues/:id       - Retrieve a specific issue
POST   /api/issues/:id/return - Mark an issue as returned
DELETE /api/issues/:id       - Delete a specific issue

USER INTERFACE:
===============
- Tab-based navigation for Authors, Books, and Issues
- Responsive design that works on various screen sizes
- Form validation for data entry
- Real-time feedback messages for user actions
- Clean, modern gradient-based design
- Intuitive sorting controls directly in table headers

HOW IT WORKS:
=============
1. The Node.js server starts and connects to MongoDB
2. Express.js handles routing for API endpoints
3. Mongoose models define data schemas and database interactions
4. Frontend makes AJAX calls to the backend API
5. Data is rendered dynamically in HTML tables
6. Users can perform all CRUD operations through the UI
7. Sorting is handled client-side with visual indicators

DEVELOPMENT PRACTICES:
======================
- RESTful API design principles
- Separation of frontend and backend concerns
- Modular code organization
- Consistent naming conventions
- Error handling and user feedback
- Semantic HTML and accessible design
